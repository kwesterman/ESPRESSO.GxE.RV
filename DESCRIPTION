Title: Power Analysis and Sample Size Calculation for a gene-environment
    interaction model

Description: The package allows for the Estimation of Sample-size and Power by
    Exploring Simulated Study Outcomes for an interaction model where the
    covariates respectively a genetic variant (SNP), an environmental/lifestyle
    exposure and an interaction term. It supports simulation-based power
    calculation for stand-alone case-control studies and for case-control
    analyses nested in cohort studies, that take account of realistic
    assessment error. This repository expands the original ESPRESSO.GxE tool to simulate aggregate tests of rare variants, in which test statistics from multiple variants are being tested jointly.
