Title: Power Analysis and Sample Size Calculation for a multi-variant gene-environment
    interaction model

Description: The package allows for the Estimation of Sample-size and Power by
    Exploring Simulated Study Outcomes for an interaction model where the
    terms are: M genetic variants (SNPs), an environmental/lifestyle
    exposure, and M interaction terms. This repository expands the original ESPRESSO.GxE tool to simulate aggregate tests of rare variants, in which test statistics from multiple variants are being tested jointly.
